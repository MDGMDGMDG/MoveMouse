# MoveMouse

Made for video sketch but because of populair demand open sourced. Super simple program that randomly moves the pointer between 2 time intervals.

Just build the program and run the .exe file

You are asked to input 2 variables, the minumum and maximum interval between mouse movements.
So when inputting 1000 and 5000 the program will randomly move between 1 and 5 seconds every time.

Quit the program by closing the window or if the mouse moves too fast press CONTROL+C on the keyboard.

This program is used in the Youtube Short sketch:
